# MPC-FX
Vintage MPC presets for current MPC output bus


# Preliminary Build
While Akai or the community at large develops a more permanent solution, these FX chains could provide a better out of the box experience for current gen MPC's 

These presets are made possible by community members who have contributed their time to Sonic Excellence. 
Side by side comparisons and source material will continousely be gathered in an effort to preserve the sound of older MPC units, and to leverage the modern day components in our current gen MPC's. 

# WHY
You could hear why, it seems a worthwhile endeavor

# What to expect
Eventually, we will get it right, until then, we'll get it how we can.
